NUtils allows you to do many functions.
You can show and hide up to 10 windows with one keystroke. This allows you to get windows such as audio repeaters out of your way.
If 10 hidden Windows are not enough for you, you can increase the number of hidden Windows by creating another stack of windows with one keystroke.
You can also change the title of a window. This is nice when you have many windows with the same title such as audio repeaters and you want to make them easier to find.
You can make windows transparent so they can be hidden yet controlled by the user.
You can forcefully kill the current window for non-responding applications.
You can modify the code and restart NUtils without having to hunt for it or even without having AutoIt installed.
You can also configure a list of windows to be automatically killed when they are seen like "Skypeâ„¢ - Receiving file. Done!".
You can hide a window in the first available slot with one keystroke.
