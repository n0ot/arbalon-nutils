Building NUtils:

Note you must compile NUtils.exe for NUtils to work. You may not run NUtils uncompiled. However, running NUtils.exe will run NUtils.au3, so any updates to NUtils.au3 will take effect when running NUtils.exe.

Building NUtils is very simple. To compile NUtils, you'll need to get AutoIt version 3.3.0.0 or later (AutoIt loves changing stuff around that breaks code written in earlier versions, so if things break, use AutoIt 3.3.0.0).
AutoIt can be downloaded at http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3

Once AutoIt is installed, right click NUtils.au3 and compile script. If you are running on x64, choose compile script (x86).

For sounds, download NUtils-sounds from http://arbalon-nutils.googlecode.com
Get NUtils-sounds.zip from the downloads page. Extract that zip archive into the src folder (you should have a folder called src\sounds).
